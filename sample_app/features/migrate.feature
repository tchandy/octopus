  As a developer

    Then the output should contain "CreateUsers: migrating - Shard: master"
    Then the output should contain "CreateUsers: migrating - Shard: asia"
    Then the output should contain "CreateUsers: migrating - Shard: europe"
    Then the output should contain "CreateUsers: migrating - Shard: america"

  Scenario: db:migrate:redo should work with octopus
    When I run inside my Rails project "rake db:migrate VERSION=20100720172715" with enviroment "development"  
    When I run inside my Rails project "rake db:migrate VERSION=20100720172730" with enviroment "development"  
    When I run inside my Rails project "rake db:migrate:redo" with enviroment "development"  
    Then the output should contain "CreateItems: reverting - Shard: master"
    Then the output should contain "CreateItems: reverting - Shard: asia"
    Then the output should contain "CreateItems: reverting - Shard: europe"
    Then the output should contain "CreateItems: reverting - Shard: america"
