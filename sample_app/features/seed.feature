  As a developer

    Then the output should contain "pending migrations"
    
  Scenario: db:seed should work with octopus
    When I run inside my Rails project "rake db:migrate" with enviroment "development"
    When I run inside my Rails project "rake db:seed" with enviroment "development"   
    Then the "asia" shard should have one user named "Asia User"
    Then the "america" shard should have one user named "America User 1"
    Then the "america" shard should have one user named "America User 2"
